              Goal International Public School,founded in 2016 by Shri A. R. 
              Nayak, was established with a clear vision to provide quality 
and global education to rural students in the Honnavar region. 
Shri A R Nayak, a visionary leader, recognized the need for an 
educational institution that could offer students from rural areas 
the same high standards of learning found in more urbanized 
centers.

with a focus on values, personality development, and cultural
